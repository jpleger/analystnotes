# Security Analyst Notes

This is a few scripts that I use to keep my analysis organized. 

## an-new.py

Creates a new analysis directory. By default this is in $HOME/analysis, but can be changed.

## TODO:
 - Create better docs
 - Package script for pypi
 - Add features
   - Better timeline support
   - Use config file for things like paths/template strings
   - User templates
   - Config file based directory structure
   - Render report
   - Pretty IOC list
